setup discourse.
get get admin username, and user api with global scope.
configue the .env file inside backend/application/ directory

run setup_venv.bat to create a virtual py environment 
install requirements.txt
go to frontend directory and run npm install to install node modules.
start 'backend.bat' file
run local_workers.sh for celery tasks. it requires RabbitMq as broker Url
run local_beat.sh for periodic celery tasks

then start 'frontend.bat' file

then visit 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/' for app frontend


why did we opted for celery tasks?
- Hosting discourse locally and calling it's APIs sometimes produces connection timeout error or sometimes it can freeze the backend API aswell. To publish new tickets and replies or other queries to Discourse we defined celery tasks for asynchronous functionality.
